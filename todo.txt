points that need fixing, as mentioned in the peer review of the remotestorage.js sync-per-node pull request, starting at https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/pull/595#issuecomment-37094704

3 - when using https://github.com/skddc/webmarks/tree/rs-0.10 on an -01 5apps account (simple will no longer be supported from now on), the same requests repeat indefinitely
     (comment: only PUTs so far /basti)
4 - sync button triggers 'undefined is not a function' or doesn't react at all
5 - possibly uncaught errors in tests
8 - add "... check the caching documentation for details" to changelog
9 - changelog baseclient#get -> baseclient#get*
10 - SEEN_AND_FOLDERS still defined in caching.js
13 - cachinglayer.js: add explanation of what this class does, existing explanation is missing context
