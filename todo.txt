points that need fixing, as mentioned in the peer review of the remotestorage.js sync-per-node pull request, starting at https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/pull/595#issuecomment-37094704
2 - remove or improve comments without context/meaning (stuff like //decided to not store error state).
3 - when using https://github.com/skddc/webmarks/tree/rs-0.10 on an -01 5apps account (simple will no longer be supported from now on), the same requests repeat indefinitely
     (comment: only PUTs so far /basti)
4 - sync button triggers 'undefined is not a function' or doesn't react at all
5 - possibly uncaught errors in tests
6 - doc/data-format.md line 62 unclear
7 - doc/data-format.md Caching Strategies: This whole paragraph is not easy enough to understand, and also some  formatting would help. But instead of having it in a separate document, 
    @skddc and @galfert both think it should be documented directly in the code and become the  introductory content of http://remotestorage.io/doc/code/files/caching-js.html
8 - add "... check the caching documentation for details" to changelog
9 - changelog baseclient#get -> baseclient#get*
10 - SEEN_AND_FOLDERS still defined in caching.js
11 - maxAge param: Why can you give it true when it's supposed to take a number of ms? I think 0 would make much more sense and also be much cleaner as a public API.
13 - cachinglayer.js: add explanation of what this class does, existing explanation is missing context
